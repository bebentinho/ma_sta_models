# minimal_action_sta_models

Codes used in the thesis "Testing the limits of the minimal-action shortcut to adiabaticity", by student Rafael Bentes de Sales, São Carlos Institute of Physics – University of São Paulo. Notice the Kitaev has two files: "Fidelity_Minimal_Action_Kitaev_QUTIP.ipynb" applies the protocol only ONCE, and "Fidelity_2nMA_Kitaev_QUTIP.ipynb" twice, on both minimal gaps, with $\omega=|\Delta|$.
